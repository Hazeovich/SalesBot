      "https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/stocks/604520/heres-why-warren-buffett-bought-hpq-stock\n",
      "Warren Buffett dipped into Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.B, $344.71) massive cash pile for the third time in the past month, initiating a commanding position in HP (HPQ, $34.91).And while some of the stocks Berkshire has been buying and selling recently might leave folks scratching their heads, this big new bet on a PC and printer maker looks very much like a classic Buffett value play.The 15 Best Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2022Berkshire late Wednesday disclosed a stake of 121 million shares in HP, worth $4.2 billion as of that day's closing price. HPQ stock predictably popped on the news, adding as much as 18% at one point soon after Thursday's opening bell.Be a smarter, better informed investor.Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and more - straight to your e-mail.Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail.Fair enough. There's nothing quite like a major vote of confidence from the world's greatest long-term investor. With 11.4% of HP's shares outstanding, Berkshire Hathaway is now the company's largest stockholder, and by a good margin.Asset management giant Vanguard, which specializes in passive investment products and therefore must own loads of stocks by default, comes in second with 10.6%, or 111.5 million shares.Suffice to say Buffett made a statement with this move.Berkshire's chairman and CEO has for years bemoaned the fact that rising asset prices have made it tough to find attractive acquisition targets or bargain stocks. The S&P 500 generated a total return of nearly 29% last year, and yet Buffett's holding company was a net seller of equities in all four quarters of 2021.65 Best Dividend Stocks You Can Count On in 2022The result is that Berkshire's cash hoard has nearly doubled over the past five years. The company ended 2021 with $146.7 billion in cash, equivalents and short-term investments. In 2016, that figure stood at $74.9 billion.But the market's rough start to 2022 has apparently changed Buffett's calculus – and prompted him to go shopping.In early March, Berkshire disclosed a series of investments in Occidental Petroleum (OXY). BRK.B is now the oil and gas firm's largest shareholder, with 14.6% of OXY's shares outstanding. A couple of weeks later, Berkshire struck a deal to acquire insurer Alleghany (Y) for $11.6 billion.The HPQ investment isn't in the same league as those other deployments of cash. But it does have the kind of attributes Buffett has exploited for long-term outperformance many times in the past.Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway portfolio comprises scores of stocks, but it's actually a highly concentrated one. Apple (AAPL) alone accounts for 46% of the portfolio's total value. Indeed, the top four holdings – AAPL, Bank of America (BAC), American Express (AXP) and Coca-Cola (KO) – come to 74% of Berkshire's equity holdings.Then there's HPQ. At just 1.2% of Berkshire's portfolio, the position, while material, isn't going to make too much of an immediate impact.Sign up for Kiplinger's FREE Closing Bell e-letter: Our daily look at the stock market's most important headlines, and what moves investors should make.Let compounding work its magic, however, and HPQ could be a savvy value play for the long haul.For one thing, HPQ generates a steady and ample stream of free cash flow (FCF) – the cash left after expenses, capital expenditures and financial commitments have been met – or an average of nearly $4 billion a year over the past five years.Industry analysts expect that FCF number to increase and – most importantly – to flow into investors' pockets.\"We think HPQ is on pace to generate annual FCF of at least $4.5 billion, with all being returned to shareholders,\" writes CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino, who rates shares at Hold.Free cash flow supports dividends, and it's no secret Buffett adores dividends. HPQ, for its part, has been not only a generous dividend payer, but a dividend grower. The company has increased its payout annually for 13 years. The most recent hike came in November – a 29% increase in the quarterly disbursement to 25 cents per share.True, the market for PCs and printers is hardly overflowing with growth prospects. But HPQ has a solid track record of slow but steady gains on the top line. Wall Street analysts see this incremental revenue growth continuing for years, all helped by recent strategic acquisitions.The 15 Best Growth Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2022The latest such deal came in March when HP agreed to acquire Poly – which combines the old Plantronics and Polycom – for $3.3 billion. The deal bolsters HPQ's offerings in headsets and cameras, as well as the video conferencing and collaboration software that goes with such gear. It's essentially a bet on permanent changes to work in the post-pandemic era.\"HP and Poly expect to deliver a complete ecosystem of devices, software and digital services to create premium workplace experiences and productivity enhancements in the age of hybrid and work-from-anywhere,\" writes Argus Research analyst Jim Kelleher (Buy). \"In this new normal, HPQ appears well positioned with its strong personal system (PC) and printing franchises.\"In addition to synergistic acquisitions and slow-but-steady revenue growth, HPQ is reliably profitable. Buffett can pretty much count on the company delivering 20% gross margins and 10% operating margins.And then there's HPQ's valuation, which Buffett appears to have found irresistible. Before shares jumped on the Berkshire news, HPQ traded at just 8.1 times analysts' 2022 earnings per share (EPS) estimate. That's despite the Street's forecast for average annual EPS growth of 27% over the next three to five years.Heck, according to data from Refinitiv Stock Reports Plus, HPQ stock was trading at a discount of 16.5% to its own five-year average on an expected earnings basis.In a word, it was cheap.Lastly, Buffett famously places a premium on experienced management. CEO Enrique Lores, who has served the company in a myriad of roles for three decades, appears to ably check that box.Buffett snatched up a boring but dependable cash machine at a bargain price.Retail investors tempted to copy the move might want to wait for a pullback, however. Price is what you pay; value is what you get, as Buffett likes to say. Sure, HPQ could still be a bargain at current levels, but it's sure not the same bargain that Berkshire just caught.11 Stock Picks That Billionaires Love\n",

(\"Apple\") announced significant changes to the iOS operating software that runs iPhones (and iPads). These changes would essentially cut off Meta's Facebook platform and its sister services from almost all the tracking and targeting abilities and information necessary to sell targeted ads as they had done for many years. Then, on February 2, 2022, Meta released weak Q4 2021 financial results and provided disappointing 2022 revenue guidance. During the related earnings call, the Company disclosed that its mitigation efforts in fact had not rendered the effects of the iOS changes \"manageable.\" Instead, Meta's advertising business would suffer a shattering $10 billion revenue hit from the iOS privacy changes. Meta also attributed its weak results and guidance on the slowing user growth due to competition from TikTok.Following these admissions, Meta's stock price fell $85.24 per share, or 26.39%, to close at $237.76 per share on February 3, 2022.Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

      "https://stockmarket.com/featured/4-top-computer-hardware-stocks-to-watch-right-now-2022-04-07\n",
      "The best computer hardware stocks show up on the radar of many investors from time to time. However, the stock market volatility may have cast a cloud over the industry for a while now. From concerns of inflation to semiconductor shortage, it is no surprise why investors may be cautious. What’s more, some of the companies in the sector which received a boost during the pandemic may now see slowing growth. That said, as hybrid working trends will likely stick around, this will likely provide support for sentiments in the computer hardware industry. So, it would be safe to assume that the long-term potential of the industry is probably still intact. Therefore, top companies with a strong foundation such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) could be solid additions to one’s portfolio right now. Not to mention, the computer hardware industry is one that emphasizes collaboration to drive innovation. Recently, Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC) and Samsung Electronics announced a memorandum of understanding for a unique collaboration. This is to standardize and drive broad adoption of next-generation data placement, processing, and fabrics storage technologies. Thus, end-users can have confidence that these emerging storage solutions will have support from multiple device vendors. All in all, let’s look at some of these top computer hardware stocks that may be worth watching in the stock market today.HP, also known as Hewlett-Packard,is one of the leading global providers of personal computers (PCs) and other access devices. Its products and services are catered to individual consumers, businesses, and even large enterprises. With more than 80 years of experience within the industry, HP believes that it can continue to innovate and provide extraordinary contributions to technology and humanity as a whole. Now, HPQ has been gaining the attention of many investors today. This is largely driven by the news that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) purchased a stake in the company stock worth $4.2 billion. In light of this, HPQ stock is climbing by over 10% at today’s opening bell. Besides that, HP also has some exciting developments of its own. Last week, the company and Legor Group SPA announced a partnership for the development of innovative precious metals for HP’s Metal Jet system. HP believes that there will come a day when all modern businesses will rely on HP’s state-of-the-art binder jetting printers in their facilities. So, this collaboration aligns perfectly with its vision to disrupt manufacturing norms and accelerate digital manufacturing. Given these compelling developments, could HPQ stock be worth watching right now?[Read More] Best Stocks To Buy Right Now? 5 Aviation Stocks To WatchAnother top computer hardware giant that would be no stranger to most would be Dell. In detail, the company operates through the Infrastructure Solutions Group segment (ISG) and Client Solutions Group (CSG) segment. The ISG segment is responsible for the digital transformation of its customers by leveraging its multi-cloud and big data solutions. On another hand, the CSG segment includes hardware and peripherals, making Dell one of the top computer hardware companies in the world. However, DELL stock has had a rough start to the year thus far. At its current valuation, some investors may argue that it would be an intriguing opportunity given the strong fundamentals that it boasts. Fiscal 2022 is the best year in Dell’s history as a listed company. Its full-year revenue was a record $101.2 billion, representing an increase of 17% year-over-year. Meanwhile, its diluted earnings per share for the year was a record $6.26, up by a whopping 114% year-over-year. This is due to the continued growth across all its business units and record personal computer shipments. So, should investors be keeping a close eye on DELL stock? Following that, we will be looking at the provider of electronic data storage technology and solutions, Seagate. The company’s principal products are hard disk drives (HDDs) but it also produces a range of electronic data storage devices such as solid-state hybrid drives, solid-state drives, and many more. In March, Seagate and ROVE announced a collaboration, providing Lyve™ Mobile and Lyve™ Cloud to solve mass data storage complexities while driving value for distributed enterprises. It would help clients accelerate time to data and enable businesses to move mass data across their datasphere regardless of the platform. Now, Seagate is not resting on its laurels. On Wednesday, the company and Phison Electronics Corp announced plans of expanding their SSD portfolio. The new SSDs will consist of next-generation high-performance, high-density enterprise NVMe SSDs. These would likely help enterprises lower total cost ownership through increased storage density, higher performance, and lower power consumption. Safe to say, this new long-term partnership will strengthen the development cycle and distribution of enterprise-class SSDs. All things considered, would you be adding STX stock to your watchlist?[Read More] Stock Market Today: Dow Jones, S&P 500 Open Mixed As Ukraine Asks NATO For More Weapons; Berkshire Stake Sends HP Stock HigherTo sum up the list, we have another top computer hardware company that is often overlooked, Lenovo. For those unaware, this is an investment holding company that engages in personal computers and related businesses. Lenovo’s core products include Think-branded commercial PCs and Idea-branded consumer PCs. Additionally, it also produces tablets, smartphones, and workstations. Recently, the company announced its bold vision for the year ahead. The vision includes building on its commitment to double investment in Research and Development (R&D). Also, the company will be hiring 12,000 R&D professionals around the world over the next three years to support this commitment. Well, such commitments are necessary as Lenovo continues its transformation from a devices company to a global technology powerhouse. On top of that, the company also announced an expansion of its global partnership with Kyndryl (NYSE: KD) in March. Together, the extended collaboration will create joint solutions that employ automation, differentiated IT infrastructure services, and optimization. Hence, it will help customers meet their mission-critical on-premises and cloud-based distributed application service needs. Overall, Lenovo appears to be making strides in the right direction for long-term growth. As such, could LNVGY stock be a hidden gem in the tech sector right now?\t\tIf you enjoyed this article and you’re interested in learning how to trade so you can have the best chance to profit consistently then you need to checkout this YouTube channel. \t\tCLICK HERE RIGHT NOW!!Midam Ventures, LLC | (305) 306-3854 | 1501 Venera Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146 | news@stockmarket.comMidam Ventures, LLC | (305) 306-3854 | 1501 Venera Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146 | news@stockmarket.com\n",

      "https://www.forbes.com/sites/gurufocus/2022/04/07/warren-buffett-continues-buying-spree-with-hp/\n",
      "SummaryBillionaire investor Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) revealed his firm established an 11.4% stake in HP Inc. (HPQ, Financial) on Wednesday, the latest in a string of large investments made by Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, Financial) (BRK.B, Financial) this year.The legendary guru, who leads the Omaha, Nebraska-based insurance conglomerate, along with his two portfolio managers, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, follows a long-term value investing approach that focuses on companies that have understandable business models, favorable long-term prospects and competent management teams that are available at attractive prices.According to Form 3 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Buffett invested in nearly 121 million shares of the Palo Alto, California-based company between April 4 and April 6.Based on HP’s closing price of $34.91 on Wednesday, the stake is worth about $4.2 billion currently. In after-hours trading, its shares popped 9.9% to $38.38 following the announcement.The personal computing and printing company has a $43.37 billion market cap; its shares were up another 16.6% at $40.71 on Thursday with a price-earnings ratio of 7.35 and a price-sales ratio of 0.74.The GF Value Line suggests the stock is modestly overvalued currently based on its historical ratios, past financial performance and future earnings projections.The GF Value Line suggests the stock is modestly overvalued.It also ranks highly in regard to its GF Score. The ranking system has been found to be closely correlated to the long-term performances of stocks based on backtesting from 2006 to 2021. With a score of 91 out of 100, HP received strong ranks for profitability, growth and momentum as well as middling ranks for financial strength and GF Value.The GF Score shows high ranks for momentum, growth and profitability.HP released its first-quarter 2022 financial results on Feb. 28, posting earnings of $1.10 per share on $17 billion in revenue. Earnings were up 20% from the prior-year quarter while revenue grew 8.8%.HP's quarterly revenue and net income growth.In a statement, President and CEO Enrique Lores praised HP’s “strong top and bottom-line results,” noting the “record revenue” was “driven by strong demand and our leadership in hybrid.”“Our Q1 performance was particularly strong across our key growth areas that collectively grew double digits including gaming, peripherals, workforce solutions, consumer subscriptions, and industrial graphics and 3D,” he said. “Our performance reflects progress against our strategy to build a stronger HP.”As part of that initiative, the company announced a month later it is buying Poly (POLY, Financial), a global provider of workplace collaboration solutions formerly known as Plantronics Inc., for $3.3 billion. The deal is expected to close by the end of the year.GuruFocus rated HP’s financial strength 6 out of 10. Despite having adequate interest coverage, the Altman Z-Score of 2.5 indicates the company is under some pressure. The return on invested capital also eclipses the weighted average cost of capital, meaning value is being created as the company grows.The company’s profitability fared even better with an 8 out of 10 rating. Although the operating margin is in decline, its returns on assets and capital outperform a majority of competitors. HP is also supported by a high Piotroski F-Score of 8 out of 9, meaning business conditions are healthy, and a predictability rank of one out of five stars. GuruFocus says companies with this rank return, on average, 1.1% annually over a 10-year period.Other gurus who were invested in HP as of the end of fourth-quarter 2021 included Dodge & Cox, PRIMECAP Management (Trades, Portfolio), Jeremy Grantham (Trades, Portfolio), Catherine Wood (Trades, Portfolio), Joel Greenblatt (Trades, Portfolio), Paul Tudor Jones (Trades, Portfolio) and Ray Dalio (Trades, Portfolio).Other recent investments and portfolioAfter several years of sitting on Berkshire’s growing cash pile, Buffett has made a number of other sizeable investments recently. In his annual shareholder letter released on Feb. 26, the investor said that \"internal opportunities deliver far better returns than acquisitions\" and little \"excites us\" in equity markets.The guru’s firm first disclosed a 29.8 million-share stake in Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY, Financial) in early March, which has since been increased to 136.4 million shares. This was soon followed by the announcement it is acquiring Alleghany Corp. (Y, Financial) for $11.6 billion.The majority of Berkshire’s $330.95 billion equity portfolio, which was composed of 44 stocks as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2021, was invested in the technology and financial services sectors.Buffett's portfolio holdings by sector.

      "TAIPEI, April 8 (Reuters) - Taiwan's exports rose for a 21st straight month in March to a new record in line with forecasts, boosted by continued strong tech demand, though the government warned of continued supply chain uncertainty and the effect of the war in Ukraine.Exports last month jumped 21.3% from a year earlier to $43.5 billion, the Ministry of Finance said on Friday, the highest monthly figure on record.A Reuters poll of analysts had forecast a 21% rise for the month, compared with a 34.8% leap in February.The ministry attributed the March growth to strong demand for electronic components as well as semiconductors, and companies increasing orders to ensure supplies to customers.Exports of electronics components rose 35.6% in March to $18.24 billion, also a monthly record, with semiconductor exports surging 38.2% from a year earlier.Many companies expect global chip shortages to last at least for the rest of the year, which will continue to fill Taiwanese semiconductor firms' order books.Firms such as TSMC (2330.TW), the world's largest contract chip-maker, are major suppliers to Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and other global tech giants, as well as providers of chips for auto companies and lower-end consumer electronics.Earlier on Friday, TSMC reported March sales of T$171.97 billion ($5.95 billion), up 33.2% from the same period last year.The finance ministry said \"enormous\" demand for chips would continue to drive exports, but warned of uncertainty over the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing war in Ukraine, supply chain bottlenecks and inflation.Ministry official Beatrice Tsai said the second quarter would likely continue to see double-digit growth, but that it was \"hard to see\" rapid growth continuing in the second half.March exports to China, Taiwan's largest trading partner, grew an annual 13.4% to $18.03 billion, compared with a 39.9% on-year rise in February, while exports to the United States jumped 36.6%, slightly slower than the 40.3% rise recorded the previous month.Imports leapt 20.3%, in line with economists' expectations of a 20.5% rise, after an increase of 35.3% in February.Taiwan could see April exports increase in the range of 13% to 17% from a year earlier, the finance ministry said.($1 = 28.8830 Taiwan dollars)Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n",

      "In his most recent letter to Berkshire Hathaway         BRK.A,        +0.71%BRK.B,        +0.60%       shareholders, Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett noted that Berkshire had spent $51.7 billion over the past two years repurchasing 9% of Berkshire’s shares. During that same period, Apple         AAPL,        -0.78%,       one of Berkshire’s largest stock holdings) repurchased more than $156 billion of its stock — described by Buffett as “an act we applaud.” More broadly, the companies in the S&P 500         SPX,        -0.38%       spent more than $5 trillion over the past decade buying back their shares.Some people (especially politicians) argue that stock repurchases are nefarious and should be outlawed. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has called share repurchases “market manipulation.” Sens. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have similarly argued that repurchase “reduces the number of publicly traded shares, boosting the value of the stock.” Even The Wall Street Journal (a sister publication to MarketWatch) joined the chorus. In a January 2020 video report, the Journal noted that buybacks are a way for a company to boost its earnings per share (EPS). The report gives an example of a company with net income of $1,000 and 100 shares, so the EPS is $10. If the company buys back 10 shares, the number of shares drops to 90 and EPS increases to $11.11, which “makes stocks look good.”The glaring and obvious fallacy in the anti-buyback argument: Where did the money come from to buy back the company’s shares?Share repurchases necessarily reduce a company’s assets, the same as if the company had used the money to pay dividends. Ignoring taxes and mispriced stock for the moment, dividends and share repurchases are both nonevents.Dividend payments put cash in every shareholder’s brokerage account, but reduce the company’s assets proportionately — leaving shareholders no better or worse off. This make sense. Transferring money from a company to its shareholders is neither inherently good or bad.Stock repurchases put cash in the sellers’ brokerage accounts and reduce both the company’s assets and the number of shares proportionately — leaving sellers and non-sellers no better or worse off. This makes sense. If a company buys anything, including its own stock, for what is worth, this doesn’t benefit or hurt its stockholders. There are three important caveats:1. Dividends and repurchases both increase the value of the company if the firm uses money that would otherwise be wasted on unprofitable ventures. But it is the abandonment of the money-losing projects that increases the value of the company, not the decision to distribute the proceeds through dividends or repurchases.2. Tax rules give share repurchases a clear advantage over dividends. Shareholders must pay taxes on dividends, but they don’t pay capital-gains taxes unless they realize their gains by selling. Even then, they don’t pay taxes on the entire sale proceeds, only the capital gain (if any). A dividend gives shareholders no alternative but to take the cash and pay taxes. With a share repurchase, shareholders have a choice. They can either sell shares and pay taxes on the capital gains, or they can let their investment ride.3. If Benjamin Graham’s “Mr. Market” has priced the stock at less than its true value, then repurchases are a hot deal — the same as if the company were to acquire another company at a discounted price. If Mr. Market’s price is too high, then repurchases are a bad deal. Thus, Buffett wrote that:“I want to underscore that for Berkshire repurchases to make sense, our shares must offer appropriate value. We don’t want to overpay for the shares of other companies, and it would be value-destroying if we were to overpay when we are buying Berkshire.”None of these caveats has anything to do with nefarious market manipulation. The bogus argument that share repurchases are a quick way to boost a company’s stock price is really just an easy and cynical way to manipulate public opinion.Gary N. Smith is the Fletcher Jones Professor of Economics at Pomona College.

      "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-pandemic-pc-boom-is-over-but-its-legacy-will-live-on-11649422108\n",
      "Before the COVID-19 pandemic struck the globe, the personal computer had become a staid, boring product with dwindling sales, as consumers spent their money on new smartphones every couple of years while letting their home laptops and old towers collect dust.That changed in a dramatic way when people retreated into their homes to avoid the virus and realized they suddenly needed to do everything—work, school, socialize—remotely. The industry was surprised: PC shipments had declined for seven consecutive years from 2012 to 2018, yet they jumped 14% in 2020 and another 14.5% in 2021, a sudden surge unseen since 2007, the year the iPhone was introduced. “The consumer market had been slowing and slowing and slowing and then, all of a sudden, we hit 2020 and people are at home, and surprisingly, consumers were buying PCs for work, gaming, content consumption, another screen at home,” said Ryan Reith, an IDC analyst.As Zoom         ZM,        -4.32%       meetings became ubiquitous for remote work and school, consumers scrambled to equip themselves and their children with computers and suddenly necessary peripherals, such as webcams and headphones — if they could find and afford them. Component shortages and overwhelming demand left scraps at electronics and office supply stores, even as inflation hit in 2021, pushing prices higher.For more: The pandemic has brought the personal computer back to life, with help from ZoomBut the renaissance of the PC might have been a relatively short era. On Wall Street there is now little expectation that PCs will continue to be a big source of growth for companies like HP Inc.        HPQ,        +0.94%       and Dell Technologies Inc.        DELL,        +1.73%,       even as Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.        BRK.A,        +0.71%BRK.B,        +0.60%makes a big bet on HP stock. IDC now forecasts that global PC industry sales will fall 1.1% in 2022 and 0.1% in 2023, as consumers largely have their new machines and students are back on school campuses.“It’s really a consumer and education slowdown,” Reith said. “If you think about all the consumers that purchased in the last two years, whether they were first-time buyers or they had not used a PC in the last whatever number of years, it’s going to take another few years before they buy another one.”Yet the activities that became pandemic staples have affected the design of PCs for the better. Remote videoconferencing and streaming are here to stay and many consumers now expect most PCs to handle the most graphically intensive videogames previously played only on consoles. The Zoom culture became so prevalent that in the first month of the stay at home orders Saturday Night Live did a hilarious skit mimicking a Zoom meeting of a small sales office. Two receptionists were unable to correctly position themselves in front of their laptop cameras, and one even took her laptop into the bathroom with her, while her boss frantically yelled “STOP!”  The latest computers and devices seem to be built to avoid such pitfalls, such as Apple Inc.’s         AAPL,        -0.78%      new Studio Display monitor that has studio quality microphones and HP’s suite of Presence technologies, including an AI camera and a privacy shutter. These tweaked designs, along with the greater acceptance of remote and hybrid work, are the legacy of the pandemic.On March 19, 2020, California Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered the state’s 40 million residents to stay in their homes due to the new pandemic threat, the nation’s first state lockdown order. Days later, Newsom issued a list of essential workers who were exempt from the lockdown, and among them were IT workers. Newsom declared that IT workers were critical, especially those who played a role in helping people to work from home, citing, “workers who produce or manufacture parts or equipment that supports continued operations for any essential services and increase in remote workforce, including computing and communication devices, semiconductors, and equipment.”Many states issued similar exceptions to their workforces, identifying essential workers who could continue to leave home to go to work, as well as lists of essential items consumers were able to leave their house to buy, like personal computers. As the stay-at-home lockdown orders piled up, Alex Cho, president of HP Inc.’s personal systems business, was briefed by his team on how many businesses around the world had stalled, but that PCs were an exception. Cho realized at that moment that the personal computer had become a big deal again.“I was sitting right here thinking, you know what, … it’s essential! It’s officially on the essential list!,” he said. “That’s when for us that phrase really was an inflection point of saying, ‘Wow, the world has changed.’ The PC is essential, it’s so essential for work, and for learning, even telehealth, and suddenly what we saw was this category was no longer this thing on the side.”Across the world, there was a frenzied upgrade of home offices, or at least the ad-hoc offices that appeared on kitchen and dining room tables. Neither families nor retailers were prepared. About a week into the stay-at-home orders, I went looking for a monitor and keyboard for my laptop to create a better workstation at home, to avoid being slouched over my work-issued laptop. By that time, there were two monitors left in a local Office Depot that was mostly occupied by swaths of empty shelves and office workers frantically searching for a sudden need, including the many techies in the Bay Area trying to find additional equipment. Fortunately my laptop was on the newer side, and it had a decent camera and audio, two key attributes in the Zoom age.I was not alone, as the same scene played out in communities worldwide. Garrett Gwinnup, a computer technician at Boise Computer Depot in Boise, Idaho, said that business has been so strong during the pandemic that his boss bought the shopping center the store was in, expanded the store and is now the landlord for the other retail spaces.“Previously desktops weren’t something you used a lot, but it has gone up tremendously since the beginning of COVID,” Gwinnup said. “He went from a very small store to a very large store in one year and a half.”The PC — often the least used and oldest electronic gadget in the home, relegated to a corner — suddenly became the most important device in the house. In addition to the huge numbers working from home, children of all ages, including college students, added another element to the picture, creating nightmarish scenarios for parents working from home, with their offspring also stuck with them while their schools figured out how to conduct remote learning. Jerry Paradise, vice president, global commercial portfolio and product management at Lenovo Group Inc. HK:992 said in an email interview that more than 1.5 billion students were forced to stay at home at some point during the pandemic. For more: The pandemic PC boom gave personal computers their biggest year in nearly a decade“All of a sudden, your three kids needed to be online and on Zoom everyday,” said Maribel Lopez, principal analyst with Lopez Research. “You might have only had one machine at home, but you had five people who needed to use it.”If a parent had a laptop from work, they were the lucky ones with a relatively newer machine. As the Zoom phenomenon began to take off as a way for companies to hold team meetings, and schools began to experiment with remote classes, it became clear the old PC was not up to the task. Unfortunately, neither was the PC supply chain.Memory chip maker Micron Technology Inc. MU reported earnings in late March 2020, just after the initial stay-at-home orders were issued. CEO Sanjay Mehrotra described for analysts on the company’s earnings conference call how Micron was sanitizing its manufacturing facilities and that its workers were social distancing on the line. The company, Mehrotra said, was dealing with border closures and a temporary shut down of its NAND assembly and test site in Malaysia, and a couple of sick workers.Read also: Micron CEO optimistic even amid unprecedented timesIt was merely the tip of the iceberg. As the pandemic wore on, supply chain disruptions and then semiconductor shortages became the biggest concerns among most hardware companies. When PC demand started to surge, it caught tech companies off guard. All over the world, each different segment of the manufacturing supply chain started to reel, as factories began to report COVID cases among their workers, disruptions that shut down production lines for brief periods.Some of the major companies were better able to deal with supply constraints, thanks to advance purchasing of memory and central processing units (CPUs), but even giants with major power such as Apple couldn’t meet all the demand. CEO Tim Cook told analysts last October that its revenue in the September quarter would have been at least $6 billion higher, had it been able to meet all the demand, and in the December quarter it was an even greater shortfall.Incredibly, the most challenging supply chain issue revolved around the paucity of small and seemingly inconsequential chips, some of which cost about $1 each, such as video drivers and audio drivers. These tiny chips, because they were on older manufacturing processes, are made by smaller, lesser known companies. In addition, these chips, especially the ones for screens, had huge competition from TVs, cars, anything with an LCD panel, said Mikako Kitagawa, a Gartner Inc. analyst.“The reason why the PC industry was so supply constrained for the last 2 years, none of the people in the industry, HP, Dell, etc. had the components for the $1 chips, none of them built a business plan for that,” IDC’s Reith said.Read more about the $1 chip that is behind record price increases for PCs.Without even these seemingly minor but actually significant chips, companies could not ship their systems, but that didn’t stop PC makers from racking up big sales in an environment where consumers were willing to pay more. From December, 2020 to December, 2021, the prices of personal computers, peripherals and smart home assistants rose 2.8% unadjusted, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Nevertheless, Apple surpassed $30 billion in Mac sales for the first time ever in its 2021 fiscal year, rising 23% from the prior year to $35.2 billion. In the holiday season that ended in December, the first quarter of Apple’s 2022 fiscal year, Mac sales hit a quarterly record of $10.8 billion. Read more about the Mac’s rebirth and its biggest growth rates everHP, with a similar fiscal year to Apple, posted record revenue in its personal-systems division of roughly $43.4 billion, growing more than 11% from the year before and pushing the company to its highest annual revenue total since splitting from Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Co. in 2015. Dell had never before topped $50 billion in annual sales, but it jumped all the way to $61.5 billion in 2021, growth of more than 27% year-over-year. Lenovo PC sales grew nearly 20% to their own record high of $54.4 billion. The stocks of Lenovo, HP, and Dell soared in the triple-digits during the last two years, while these once-staid business segments blossomed in the pandemic. Apple, which trades mostly around iPhone and services sales, saw a huge resurgence of interest in the Mac.Wall Street, though, is bracing for a slowdown. In recent weeks, there have been a series of downgrades in the sector, focusing on expectations for slower growth. Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring lowered his price targets on HP and Dell, citing a downward risk on hardware budgets, and more consumer caution, especially in light of inflationary trends. Read more about Wall Street’s fears about the end of the pandemic PC boomIn a note to clients, Woodring said there were three reasons he had become extremely cautious about consumer demand for PCs in 2022. He’s convinced demand was simply pulled forward in 2021 and the first half of 2022; Morgan Stanley’s survey work indicated worsening consumer sentiment due to inflation; and he sees growing evidence of a supply-demand rebalance. “We believe PC and consumer hardware spending will be pressured as supply improves and demand normalizes after two years of above-trend growth.” Woodring wrote.Even if the boom is over, however, it will leave its mark, as all the major PC makers continue to roll out new machines with features geared to doing so much more from home than before the pandemic.“Audio and video and being able to show up, with a level of audio and video and fidelity that isn’t distracting, is now of much higher importance,” HP’s Cho said on a Zoom chat with MarketWatch. “People recognize this is important, especially if I am going to do this on an ongoing basis. That is also driving a whole new wave of innovation and upgrades.”See also: HP CEO says we’re still in a PC boom, and his company’s record sales prove itIn the past few months, many of the biggest PC makers launched products to include features for better videoconferencing, and features for hybrid work. For example, Dell’s recently added features across its portfolio of commercial systems that include a docking station with wireless charging for earbuds. HP’s recent entrants include better monitors and cameras that can reduce noise reduction, and an ability to enhance your on-screen image for meetings. Lenovo and ASUS have launched dual-screen laptops, with a second smaller screen on the keyboard area to act as a sort of mini, second monitor.“Given that people are spending more time at home, and many are using the same device for their professional and personal lives, we have seen an increased interest in premium features,” said Paradise of Lenovo.In the past few months, demand for PCs has been coming from the commercial side of the business, as consumers have pretty much settled into the remote setups created months ago. But commercial demand is being driven by  new needs, like shared drop-in desks, videoconferencing with remote workers, and audio improvements.“These are huge shifts, secular changes, in how people are living and working,” Cho said. “People’s expectations are changing and the role of the office is changing.” He said one of his co-workers recently sent an out-of-office email response that said he was “in the office, collaborating with peers,” and his response time would be slow“We are seeing a big uptick right now in the large enterprise space as companies return to the office and retrofit technology to ensure they’re ready for hybrid work,” said Lenovo’s Paradise. “There’s huge demand in return-to-office for high-end systems, corporate systems, desktops and notebooks, and videoconference systems.” He said in Lenovo’s fiscal third quarter, commercial sales jumped 23%.More from Therese: As growth slows, where does Zoom go from here?HP and Dell both observed big increases in commercial sales in the January quarter, with HP seeing that sector soar 26% in its first fiscal quarter, ended Jan. 31, while consumer revenue fell 1%. Dell saw even bigger growth, with a surge of 30% in commercial revenue, and a 16% jump in consumer revenue, up from a year ago.Analysts believe commercial sales will outpace consumer this year, but that consumer sales will pick up a bit again in the fall. “We will see a lull around the summer and then some pick up for back to school,” said Lopez, of Lopez Research.Some components will continue to be in short supply. Right as companies were catching up, a new wave of covid briefly shut down some manufacturing in some areas of China in December and January. The war in Ukraine is also expected to have an impact on some raw materials and gases used for making semiconductors.Paradise of Lenovo, though, said he believed that the “worst of the supply chain shortages are behind us.”Amid the weakening backdrop after a record year, PC growth is showing signs of slowing, and the strong commercial market is not enough to keep the overall category from slowing down. Corporate sales will keep growth up this year, but Micron’s CEO said during the company’s recent quarter earnings that he sees “flattish” unit shipments overall.IDC, before the invasion of Ukraine and the recent lockdowns in China, had been expecting 2022 unit growth to fall 1%. “While I don’t have a new number for you right now, I would safely say we do not believe the market will be stronger than the -1% and even faces some slight downside risk because of the macro and geopolitical activities,” Reith said.If those projections come true, the pandemic PC boom will truly have ended. But with machines built for a new era and a supply chain that has been tested and hopefully improved, the PC industry has changed permanently, as has consumers’ view of a tech product that was barely in their thoughts just a couple of years ago.\n",

      "https://stockmarket.com/featured/stock-market-today-dow-jones-s-wd-40-up-on-strong-earnings-2022-04-08\n",
      "On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up by 20 points. This comes as investors continue to anticipate the next policy moves by the Federal Reserve. Fresh commentary from Fed officials gives a hawkish outlook. For instance, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard recently said that he wanted the Fed to get to between 3% to 3.25% on the Fed funds rate in the second half of the year. This would imply more aggressive, front-loaded interest rate hikes in the near term. Tech stocks continue to take the brunt of the accompanying rise in Treasury yields. Stocks like Amazon ( NASDAQ: AMZN) are down by over 4% in the past 5 trading sessions.Recently, Spirit Airlines (NYSE: SAVE) says that it will begin talks with JetBlue (NASDAQ: JBLU) to acquire Spirit in an all-cash transaction for $33.00 per share. The bid is approximately $3.6 billion. Spirit had agreed earlier this year to be taken over by Frontier Airlines parent Frontier Group (NASDAQ: ULCC) but said the JetBlue offer could lead to a “superior proposal.”Among the Dow Jones leaders, shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are down by 1.28% today while Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is also down by 1.29%. Meanwhile, Disney (NYSE: DIS) and Nike (NYSE: NKE) are trading lower on Friday. Among the Dow financial leaders, Visa (NYSE: V) is down by 0.32% while JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) is up by 0.91%.Shares of EV leader Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) are down by 3.02% on Friday. Rival EV companies like Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) are also down by 3.65%. Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID) is also down by 2.53% today. Chinese EV leaders like Nio (NYSE: NIO) and Xpeng Motors (NYSE: XPEV) opened lower today.Following the stock market opening on Friday, the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq are trading lower at 0.49%, 0.03%, and 1.26% respectively. Among exchange-traded funds, the Nasdaq 100 tracker Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ) is down by 1.22% while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA: SPY) is also down by 0.45%. The 10-year Treasury yield continues to tick higher today, topping 2.704%. This hits a fresh 3-year high on Friday as investors continue to dissect the minutes from the previous Fed meeting. The Fed minutes that were published on Wednesday indicate that the central bank plans to shrink its balance sheet by $95 billion a month. Fed officials also suggested there could be one or more 50-basis-point interest rate hikes on the cards.Oil prices continue to inch higher today, with West Texas Intermediate crude at $96 per barrel. This comes after the U.S. announced its largest-ever release from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve and International Energy Agency member nations also joined the effort to combat soaring oil prices and gasoline prices.[Read More] Top Stock Market News For Today April 8, 2022WD-40 (NASDAQ: WDFC) is making waves in the stock market today. Crucially, this is thanks to the company’s latest quarterly financial release. Getting straight to it, WD-40 posted earnings of $1.41 per share, crushing analyst estimates of $1.01. Additionally, the company is also looking at a total revenue of $130 million, up from $111.9 million in the same quarter last year. After considering the substantial earnings beat from WD-40, the hype around WDFC stock is understandable. As it stands, the company’s shares are trading higher by over 12% today.More importantly, this is happening even as the company trims its fiscal 2022 net income guidance. WD-40 is currently reducing its earnings outlook by about 2%. According to CEO Garry Ridge, this is mainly due to the “challenging inflationary environment we are currently operating in.” For its annual sales, WD-40 is forecasting a figure between $522 million and $547 million. Nevertheless, the company’s performance for the latest quarter is commendable. Ridge explains, “The enhancements we have made have enabled us to increase the production capacity of our highest volume products and return to solid growth in our largest market, the United States, which experienced a 26 percent increase in maintenance product sales in the second quarter.” All in all, as the company continues to navigate current market conditions effectively, WDFC stock is on the rise.[Read More] 4 Top Computer Hardware Stocks To Watch Right NowAnother stock market news headliner today is CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD). By and large, this is likely a result of the company’s latest nod from the U.S. government. In detail, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) is now officially granting CrowdStrike Impact Level 4 authorization. While it is a provisional authorization, it still marks a strategic win for CrowdStrike. Why is this so might you ask? Well, this security clearance means that it can better access controlled unclassified information (CUI) at the federal level. Accordingly, this provides CrowdStrike with deeper insights into confidential government files, allowing the company to better protect them.In practice, CrowdStrike can now efficiently deploy its Falcon cybersecurity platform across a vast array of government clients. The likes of which mainly consist of DoD and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) divisions. Overall, the Falcon platform’s key focus here would be to protect the CUI assets of these departments from cyber threats. Despite its current momentum on this front, CrowdStrike remains steadfast in its growth strategy. This is apparent as the company is already gunning for an Impact Level 5 authorization. Namely, the information comes from CrowdStrike’s chief security officer, Shawn Henry. Furthermore, Henry also speaks on the importance of this news. He says, “This authorization will further CrowdStrike’s support to federal agencies in defending against modern cyber threats, and we remain committed to bolstering our engagements with the public sector.” Not to mention, the company’s latest team-up with Mandiant (NASDAQ: MNDT), another cybersecurity firm, is also worth considering. The two companies are working together to support joint clients via software integrations between their flagship platforms. As a result of all this, CRWD stock is up by over 3% at today’s opening bell.\t\tIf you enjoyed this article and you’re interested in learning how to trade so you can have the best chance to profit consistently then you need to checkout this YouTube channel. \t\tCLICK HERE RIGHT NOW!!Midam Ventures, LLC | (305) 306-3854 | 1501 Venera Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146 | news@stockmarket.comMidam Ventures, LLC | (305) 306-3854 | 1501 Venera Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146 | news@stockmarket.com\n",

      "AAPL: Apple vs. Cisco Systems: Which Mega-Cap Stock is a Better Buy?\n",
      "https://stocknews.com/news/aapl-csco-apple-vs-cisco-systems-which-mega-cap-stock-is-a-better/\n",
      "Tech behemoth Apple Inc. (AAPL) in Cupertino, Calif., is known for its innovative products, such as iPhones. In addition, the company offers numerous services that include Apple Arcade, Apple Music, Apple News+ and Apple TV+. It has a $2.92 trillion market capitalization. In comparison, with a market cap of $226.94 billion, Cisco Systems (CSCO) in San Jose, Calif., designs, manufactures, and sells Internet Protocol-based networking and other communications and information technology products. In addition, it provides infrastructure platforms, including networking technologies for switching, routing, wireless, and data center products.Concerns surrounding multi-decade high inflation, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and rising crude oil prices have raised questions about the stock market’s stability. In addition, after announcing its first interest rate hike in more than three years, the Federal Reserve is expected to get more aggressive with rate increases to fight inflation. Furthermore, the United States imposed a new round of sanctions on Russia on Wednesday. Against this backdrop, it could be wise to invest in mega-cap stocks because of their impressive market dominance and solid long-term growth prospects. So, both AAPL and CSCO could generate steady returns in the long term.AAPL stock has gained 8.1% in price over the past month, while CSCO has negative returns. Also, AAPL’s 19.1% gain over the past nine months is significantly higher than CSCO’s 2.6% returns. Furthermore, in terms of the past years’ performance, AAPL is the clear winner with 34.6% gains versus CSCO’s 5.5% returns.But which of these two stocks is a better buy now? Let’s find out.Latest DevelopmentsOn Jan. 27, 2022, AAPL’s board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share of the company’s common stock. The dividend was payable on February 10, 2022, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 7, 2022.On March 1, 2022, CSCO and Rakuten signed a strategic agreement to accelerate the open RAN and Telco cloud market. Jonathan Davidson, Executive Vice President and General Manager, Mass-Scale Infrastructure Group, Cisco, said, “Together with Rakuten Symphony, we have the unique opportunity to offer global service providers an alternative to legacy RAN, with a turnkey option to transform their networks to be more intuitive and automated to support the ever-evolving needs for connectivity.”Recent Financial ResultsAAPL’s net sales increased 11.2% year-over-year to $123.95 billion for its fiscal first quarter, ended Dec. 25, 2021. Its operating income grew 23.7% year-over-year to $41.49 billion. Its net income increased 20.4% year-over-year to $34.63 billion, and its EPS came in at $2.10, up 25% year-over-year.CSCO’s net revenue increased 6% year-over-year to $12.70 billion for its fiscal second quarter, ended Jan. 29, 2022. The company’s non-GAAP operating income grew 6% year-over-year to $4.40 billion, while its non-GAAP net income came in at $3.50 billion, representing a 6% year-over-year increase. Its non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.84, up 6% year-over-year.Past and Expected Financial PerformanceAAPL’s revenue and EPS have grown at CAGRs of 13.1% and 25.7%, respectively, over the past three years. The company’s revenue is expected to increase 8.3% in the current year and 5.6% next year. Its EPS is expected to grow 10% in the current year and 6.5% next year. Also, AAPL’s EPS is expected to grow at 10.3% per annum over the next five years.In comparison, CSCO’s revenue and EPS have grown at CAGRs of 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively, over the past three years. Analysts expect CSCO’s revenue to increase 6.1% in the current year and 5.3% next year. The company’s EPS is expected to grow 6.8% in the current year and 8.4% next year. Furthermore,  its EPS is expected to grow at 7.1% per annum over the next five years.ProfitabilityAAPL’s trailing-12-month revenue is 7.34 times CSCO’s. AAPL is also relatively more profitable, with EBITDA and net income margins of 33.89% and 26.58%, respectively,  compared to CSCO’s 31.02% and 22.94%.However, AAPL’s 145.57%, 19.87%, and 37.86% respective ROE, ROA, and ROTC are higher than CSCO’s 30.08%, 9.28%, and 16.49%.ValuationIn terms of forward non-GAAP P/E, AAPL is currently trading at 27.91x, which is 76.9% higher than CSCO’s 15.78x. Furthermore, AAPL’s 21.12x forward EV/EBITDA is 90.6% higher than CSCO’s 11.08x.So, CSCO is the more affordable stock.POWR RatingsAAPL has an overall rating of C, which translates to Neutral. In contrast, CSCO has an overall rating of B, which equates to a Buy in our proprietary POWR Ratings system. The POWR Ratings are calculated considering 118 distinct factors, with each factor weighted to an optimal degree.CSCO has a grade of A for Quality. This is justified given TSM’s 30.08% trailing-12-month ROCE, 312.4% higher than the industry average of 7.30%. On the other hand, AAPL has a Quality grade of B.AAPL has a C grade for Stability, consistent with its beta of 1.19. In comparison,  CSCO also has a B grade for Stability, in sync with its beta of 0.95.Of the 54 stocks in the Technology – Communication/Networking industry, CSCO is ranked #6. However, AAPL is ranked #19 out of 45 stocks in the Technology – Hardware industry.Beyond what I have stated above, we have also rated the stocks for Sentiment, Growth, Value, and Momentum.

However, even though both stocks are expected to gain in the long run, we think it is better to bet on CSCO now because of its better stability and lower valuation.Our research shows that odds of success increase when one invests in stocks with an overall rating of Strong Buy or Buy.

      "NEW YORK, April 8 (Reuters) - The Dow rose and the S&P 500 ended lower in choppy trade on Friday, as beaten-down bank shares gained and investors grappled with how best to deal with an economy that could skid as the Federal Reserve moves to aggressively tackle inflation.The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note hit a three-year high of 2.73%, helping boost the S&P banking index (.SPXBK), which rose 1.18%, after slumping to 13-month lows on Thursday.

      "Is It Too Late to Buy HP Stock?\n",
      "https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/04/08/is-it-too-late-to-buy-hp-stock/\n",
      "HP's (HPQ 0.94%) stock price surged 15% to a 52-week high on April 7 after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.71%) (BRK.B 0.60%) disclosed a new $4.2 billion investment in the PC and printer maker. The purchase gives Berkshire an 11.4% stake in HP and makes it the company's largest shareholder.That's great news for HP's investors, but is it too late for other investors to hop on the bandwagon after Berkshire's big buy? Let's review HP's business, how it aligns with Berkshire's investing strategies, and if this stock still has room to run after more than doubling over the past three years.Image source: HP.HP spun off its enterprise business as Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE 2.74%) in 2015. After that separation, the \"new\" HP only sold PCs, printers, and printing supplies to the consumer and commercial markets.HP initially struggled with sluggish demand for its PCs as consumers pivoted toward smartphones, tablets, and convertible devices. But under Dion Weisler, who served as HP's CEO from 2015 to 2019, the company revived the stagnant PC business with fresh designs for high-end notebooks, convertible devices, all-in-one computers, and gaming desktops.The printing business also initially struggled with lengthy upgrade cycles, competition from generic ink and toner suppliers, and the rise of paperless workplaces. However, Weisler also stabilized the printing business by launching a cost-efficient subscription service for its ink cartridges, increasing its scale by acquiring Samsung's printing business and the office equipment dealer Apogee, and developing a new line of industrial 3D printers.When Weisler handed the reins to HP's current CEO Enrique Lores, the company's core businesses were generating slow but stable growth again.But in fiscal 2020, which ended in October of the calendar year, it suffered another slowdown as businesses shut down during the pandemic and suspended their upgrades of new devices. It partly cushioned that blow by selling more consumer-facing PCs and printers for people who were working remotely and creating DIY projects at home, but its revenue still fell 4% for the full year as its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) rose just 2%.The situation improved significantly in 2021 as more businesses reopened. The acceleration of its commercial business also offset the post-lockdown deceleration of its printing business, and its total revenue and adjusted EPS increased 12% and 66%, respectively, for the full year. Analysts expect its revenue and EPS to grow 4% and 13%, respectively, in 2022.Warren Buffett usually favors cash-rich companies that return a lot of their free cash flow (FCF) to investors through big buybacks and dividends. Over the past two years, HP returned more than 100% of its FCF to its investors, even as its commercial business faced pandemic-related disruptions.PeriodFY 2019FY 2020FY 2021Free Cash Flow$4.0 billion$3.9 billion$4.2 billionBuybacks$2.4 billion$3.1 billion$6.2 billionDividends$1.0 billion$997 million$938 millionPercentage of FCF Returned85%105%172%Data source: HP.Its buybacks also reduced its number of outstanding shares by 30% over the past three years as its stock price rose more than 100%. This indicates the company isn't simply using buybacks to offset its dilution from stock-based compensation plans, and that its purchases were well-timed.Apple (AAPL -0.78%), Berkshire's largest holding, also reduced its share count by 11% over the past three years as its stock price rose nearly 240%.HP expects its FCF to rise to \"at least\" $4.5 billion in fiscal 2022 and to spend more than $4 billion of that cash on buybacks. As for its dividend, it currently pays a high forward yield of 2.9%, and it's raised that payout every year since it split with HPE.As of this writing, HP's stock still trades at just eight times forward earnings. By comparison, Apple has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 30.HP's stock is cheap because analysts expect its slowdown to continue as the remote work tailwinds fade, the chip shortage drags on, and the company braces for another long upgrade cycle for PCs and printers. Inflation, weaker consumer spending, and other macro headwinds could also reduce the market's near-term appetite for its products.But Warren Buffett famously said: \"Whether socks or stocks, I like buying quality merchandise when it is marked down.\" HP is clearly being marked down because investors anticipate a near-term slowdown.However, HP merely faces a cyclical slowdown instead of a secular one. HP's sales of PCs and printers might ebb and flow with the hardware upgrade cycles, but the company will still keep generating plenty of cash for fresh buybacks and dividends. Those shareholder-friendly measures -- which likely drew Berkshire to HP -- indicate it's not too late to buy the stock.\n",

Today, we're going to talk about the battle of low-cost airlines, Amazon's fixed satellite move, and restaurant brands in the metaverse. [MUSIC] Let's begin with the big story which is JetBlue's move yesterday, they are announcing a proposal to acquire Spirit Airlines for $33 per share in cash, works out to a total of 3.6 billion. There was already a planned merger between Spirit and Frontier that was announced in February. This is really interesting because JetBlue thinks it's offering a better deal than the offer from Frontier, which is true from a monetary perspective. Frontier's bid would give Spirit shareholders a share of the combined airline as well as some cash per share. Really interesting because these are two very different types of airlines whereas Frontier and Spirit are more aligned. Asit, I'm wondering what you think could happen next and what this means for consumers?Asit Sharma: Well, I'm going to be totally honest with you Deidre, I don't know what's going to happen [laughs] next because this counteroffer is going to have some regulatory scrutiny around it, but let's hypothesize that the deal goes through. I think this means that for consumers, costs are going up. The reason is JetBlue has a choice to become more like Spirit or to make Spirit become more like itself, and I think the odds are that JetBlue tries to mold Spirit in its own form. You've got an airline here which has been pretty successful in JetBlue at offering some premium perks, it's not quite the large carrier like those it wants to compete with, the Uniteds, American Airlines, and Deltas of the world. It's an up-and-coming airline, it's slightly smaller than a great regional airline, Alaska Airlines. If the merger goes through with Spirit, it will leapfrog that to become the next big carrier. I think what JetBlue is trying to do here is to really compete with these bigger carriers, it can't recreate the whole hub and spoke network that the legacy carriers have, but what it can do is to really hone in on route density, which is what it gets in Spirit because both are East Coast Airlines and the thing that I like about this for JetBlue, not for myself and I travel, if my costs are going up, but what I liked for JetBlue is that in buying Spirit, it gets a really beautiful route density into Latin America, into Central America, into the Caribbean, routes it doesn't have. Those are very lucrative routes, the travel in this area from Latin America to the US back-and-forth has been steadily increasing, took a hit during COVID, but long-term, that's a great place to be. You buy, Spirit you get into a bunch of big cities in the East Coast and some other hub cities, you compete with the bigger carriers, you get great route additions. It'll take some time. You can make the Spirit part of your business more like JetBlue which is not, again, a premium airline but think of it as a lower-cost carrier with some perks, not an ultra-low-cost carrier, just one or two steps above that.Deidre Woollard: Interesting. I like what you said there about ultra-low-cost versus low-cost because that's Frontier's argument is that JetBlue is, in fact, prestige and so that it's not a natural match. The other thing I think is interesting is JetBlue has tried some acquisitions before, they haven't worked out, there's certainly an antitrust concern here. Do you think that that's going to be a concern? How are the regulators going to look at these two deals?Asit Sharma: I want to say it is a shot from left field. If you've read any of the new stories around the story, many airline analysts, and I'm not an airline analyst, but I totally get this, they're scratching their heads just because of the regulatory aspect. This is a move that is the opposite of a Frontier-Spirit merger in which costs could stay level for consumers. You got two ultra-low-cost carriers that would be merging. Here, how does this benefit the end-user? It doesn't. Now, JetBlue can make the argument that in becoming a bigger airline, not quite as big as these huge competitors I mentioned before, we make that part of the airline segment more competitive, we come in and compete with bigger carriers. I think that's a bit of a stretch but there is some logic there. I don't know where regulators will land. I think this is indicative of a company in JetBlue that is really looking to grow but doesn't have a great organic path to do it. They're not grasping at straws here, but they're going after propositions which aren't natural fits. This is what happens in an industry like the airline industry where you have just decades of consolidations, just a few players on the big end. To get bigger in this industry is not so easy.Deidre Woollard: Very good point. Just to wrap up, what are you thinking about the energy costs and airlines, prices seem to be going up for airlines, looks like we're going to have a big travel summer. What are you thinking that we're going to see on that front?Asit Sharma: It's so interesting, Deidre. The two biggest costs for an airline are labor, of course, and fuel. We've seen over time that airlines will go for utilization, they want to fill seats. They will deal with higher fuel prices in a number of ways. The best way, I think, over time to counter the effect of rising fuel costs is to add on ancillary services. This is something that JetBlue excels at. I don't think that there is much that any airline can do in the industry just now, they're going to have to absorb some of these costs, the rest, you and I are going to be paying more when we board. I will tell you one thing, I'm traveling this summer. [laughs] Please world, please universe, please cosmos, no more exogenous shocks, give me just even a couple of weeks of a window in which I can have some fun travel; I will get on a plane this summer.Deidre Woollard: [laughs] I think you are not alone in that. Let's move on from airlines to space. Amazon has announced ramping up Project Kuiper, which is its satellite operations. This is really ambitious, they are planning 83 launches over the next five years, they're putting more than 3,000 satellites in orbit. Why? Because they're going to try to provide broadband Internet for consumers, businesses, government agencies, some massive project. Really interesting to see, and I'm wondering what this means for Amazon's core businesses for Prime, AWS, things like that.Asit Sharma: This is a multi-year effort and it sounds like it won't have much impact on Amazon's business for a while because they've got to get the satellites into space. I believe that Amazon does have a little bit of an impetus to start putting it satellites into space because of some licensing requirements. They received licenses from the Federal Communications Commission in 2020, they've got to start putting up satellites within the next couple of years to keep those initial license grants. There's nothing on the surface or in the immediate future that's going to impact the other businesses. But, Deidre, I remember that Morgan Stanley had a projection, I don't know, a couple of years ago which they said that this total space business, putting satellites into space and having consumer services is going to be potentially a trillion-dollar business for lucky few companies over the next 10 years. Now, who on earth has the capital to put thousands of satellites in space? Only a very few private companies or public companies can do this. While we look at this large opportunity that is going to cost, by Amazon's own estimates, $10 billion of its capital, potentially they get a fraction of this market, say five or 10 percent, that starts to impact the other business lines. Let's fast-forward, I don't know, six or seven years in the future, and that's where you start to get some incremental gravy that's flowing to Amazon's bottom line, it makes them better able to compete with that additional cash flow, to lower their infrastructure costs for stuff that we order here on earth. In that sense, it will potentially have an impact on those other businesses, it's just not going to happen overnight.Deidre Woollard: Yeah, I think there's so much potential. One of the things I've heard about is the potential for data centers in space and things like that. There's all sorts of interesting applications. You mentioned big companies. Well, the other one in this is, of course, Elon Musk and Starlink. There's been a lot of talk, a lot of back-and-forth between the two, a bit of one upmanship about Blue Origin versus SpaceX. Is Amazon too far behind Starlink to catch up at this point? Starlink has already launched about 1,900 satellites, they've got a quarter of a million subscribers. Does this mean Elon's got the jump on basis or what?Asit Sharma: Yeah, you know Deidre, this is a G-rated shows. They don't mean any innuendo here. But I was wondering seven years old, I walked into a friend's garage and there was a sign that my friend's mom had put in the garage and it was a common saying. This is just to think back to the early '80s here, late '70s. The only difference between men and boys is the size of their toys. The picture was of two boats; a little boat and, and a big boat in the water. This is what it's boiling down to with all these billions of excess capital that Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk have created. They want bigger toys. They are in the never ending contest to see who can win here on the planet and in space. It's a great question. I mean, has Elon just, in this part of the competition, just gotten the head-start and Bezos can't compete? Actually don't think so. Again, going back to the point I was discussing earlier about the capital required to put all these satellites, thousand satellites into space. If only a few companies can do this, it means that there's not going to be a monopoly business in space. It's probably going to be like a duopoly or oligopoly, is that right? We have more than a couple. There's always time to catch up, especially if you're relying on a consumer model. At the end of the day, these are consumers that are going to propel this. It could get into corporate business later, as you mentioned with say, data centers in space. But with a consumer centric monopoly regulators, just the idea of competing lent itself to another company, even if it takes a couple or three years more entering that. Now, do Amazon and Starlink between them have a business model that's probably airtight, they don't have to worry about much more competition? Yeah, I don't see many more companies coming into the scale.Deidre Woollard: One last thing on this subject, I am a little bit concerned about the potential for things being crowded. There's already been talk of not necessarily space junk, but when these things, when they exceed their usefulness, they have to be disposed at some way. They can come to earth and burn up in the atmosphere. We haven't seen a lot of crashes or things like that yet. But do you think going forward when we have thousands of satellites in orbit, is that a potential risk?Asit Sharma: I'm worried. I'm no expert on objects in orbit, but we noticed from reading the news that the number of satellites which have been put up ever since the first one launched into space in the '50s, just that tiny number of satellites creates its own ecosystem of space debris. So you think about multiplying that even if these are much smaller satellites. We should think about multiplying the number of objects by so many magnitudes. It just begs the question, that this potentially isn't that great an idea in terms of efficiency? So yeah, I think me and so many other people who are watching this story evolve or worried and you as, well, hopefully the technology that's being invested, will be able to anticipate this, but I have my doubts. I'm a little skeptical on that front.Deidre Woollard: Well, I think it may create a new business in the future. But let's move on from space. I feel like we're getting gradually further and further out. Let's go into the metaverse. Wanted to talk a little bit about a Wall Street Journal article about Restaurant Brands setting up shop in the metaverse, Wendy's and Chipotle. We've already seen McDonald's talk about ordering your food in the metaverse through so much excitement from brands. But the interesting thing in the article was that there was a study from Forrester that showed 43 percent of adults would avoid a brand sponsored experience in the metaverse. That's not great news. Is this a smart move for brands to get started in the metaverse? Is this where we're headed?Asit Sharma: It depends on the brand and what your objective is and who your customers are. Thinking in some cases it makes a lot of sense. My typical example is Nike creating an experience on Roblox, which is good for its culture, for its fans, they can go and experience Nike land. So this is an example and I know, Deidre, you have some thoughts here. I'm really interested to hear your thoughts on these. I want to just finish this short opinion by saying, in some cases short, it makes a lot of sense and in others. It's like that song. We're not going to take it. We're not going to take it anymore. Brands try to sell to us in every conceivable location and we're used to this, but they are selling to us on social media. They are selling to us in the subways. So do I really want to be sold to in the metaverse? Maybe more pertinently, if your quick service brands, like do I want to be dragged into the metaverse just to place an order for delivery? Not me personally. I don't think it makes as much sense for brands that have a quick service model in the restaurant industry. These two examples of McDonald's, especially with Wendy's and Chipotle is in there as well. But, yeah it can be valuable to some companies. Now, I've tried to stay a little neutral there, but you've got thoughts and opinions. I know on this. What's your take on this, Deidre?Deidre Woollard: Well, I've been studying the way that luxury brands are getting in. Specifically, they had the first metaverse Fashion week recently in Decentraland. Part of it was that Dolce and Gabbana had this $300,000 metaverse tiara. Neiman Marcus recently announced that they're working on NFT. So I find it fascinating from the luxury perspective and I think that may be more of a natural fit for the metaverse at this point than some of the more mid-market brands. Just because really the people that are interested in the metaverse, it's a small group, but it may be a more sophisticated group of consumers. So I've been fascinated by seeing just how many luxury brands are getting in, makes me think a little bit of second-life for those who remember that happened. What was that about a decade ago and all brands rushed in. Second-life is still out there. Their CEO recently came back, but Second-life never became what we thought it was going to be. So there's a little bit of concern there.Asit Sharma: Yes. There's another arguments that younger consumers, the digitally native consumers, are going to embrace the metaverse, and so you need to your expression of the metaverse in now because it's only a matter of time before, let's say someone in their teens grows up for few years and they have their own spending money and they're going to spend it. They'll be the people going into the metaverse to order from McDonald's, but I'm not so sure. I mean, there's part of the metaverse that's still seems very much like a transient thing. We're always trying to pin the next technological innovation and say, this is how the world is going to work. We were talking about 3D just before the show, Deidre. We were talking about visual 3D, but I was also thinking about 3D printing. I remember just a few years ago, we were going to print everything we needed from our homes. Like if if something broken your house, you just go to your 3D printer, print it up and put it, let's say replace a couch like that really never came to fruition. Although 3D printing is in various parts of the economy in it's more serious expression of additive manufacturing is there, it exists, but it hasn't overtaken our lives. I have my suspicion that even for younger people, the metaverse will be the dominant place that we exist, interact and transact in the future. Deidre Woollard: Coming up next, Jim Gillies and Brian Feroldi are going to take a bull versus bear approach to a company that Amazon was supposed to knockout years ago. Best Buy, Ricky Mulvey moderates and you get to decide who made the better argument by voting in our poll on Motley Fool Money on Twitter. Ricky Mulvey: We got Bull versus Bear on Best Buy today. You know the electronics retailer, it is within 10 miles of 70 percent of the US population. They sell computers, games, whatever you want, Best Buy's got it. Taking the bear case, we got Brian Feroldi. Brian, you got a book out just came out yesterday. It's called Why Does The Stock Market Go Up? But looking at the risks to a company that's not unfamiliar to you, you like putting stocks through the gauntlet all the time.Brian Feroldi: Yeah, I've made plenty of mistakes with investing and I've learned the hard way that you need to know the bull case for a business just as well as you know the bear case for a business if you want to make an informed decision.Ricky Mulvey: We've got the returning champion, the Canuck Jim Gillies. Jim, you also have a book that came out a few years ago that you'd like to plug.Jim Gillies: It's my masters thesis on bringing environmental aspects to a chromium plating shop. There are four copies in existence, no one should read it.Ricky Mulvey: Books are available on Amazon but let's get right to it on Best Buy starting with the bull case. Jim, you've got three minutes.Jim Gillies: Cool. Well, I know that Brian, my esteemed opponent, likes company mission statements and so I thought I would start with one of his favorite tricks and I'm going to call out with Best Buy's purposes, they state their purpose is to enrich lives through technology. Now the important thing here is this is an adaptable company. This is a service company that sells hardware technology, yes, you can go to Amazon or eBay or wherever you buy your electronic and online stuff but their customer service model that Best Buy offers is essentially impossible for Amazon to copy. Amazon is for people who know exactly what they want, want it at a better price for example and will implement their own technology solutions for themselves and God bless them. People think of hardware and technology as something of a commodity, the reality is it's more nuanced. Sometimes people don't know what they want, sometimes they would choose differently or might want something completely different if they had a better understanding, there's different fulfillment or installation options, sometimes my parents want someone to hold their hand when they're getting their technology setup or what have you and that is the service that Best Buy provides in the guys of a big box store. You can get in-person consultations online, on the phone, pickup and delivery, curbside pickup, home visits delivery, the point is its flexibility and adaptability to customer needs and it has worked.Best Buy is one of my favorite types of retail company stories because people, including my esteemed opponent, have been writing this one off for well over a decade. Would you like to take a guess as to what the best year in company history was in terms of free cash flow generation for Best Buy? If you guessed fiscal 21, the year ending in January 2021, aka the year stricken by shutdowns for the pandemic, you are right. Of course no one is going to guess, the pandemic year was the best year free cash flow production in Best Buy's history, they made $4.2 billion. If you want to guess the second best year in the company's history, it's in the year that's just ended where they produced $2.5 billion in free cash flow. Now, true, I think fiscal 2012 was about $25 million more or $12 million more but that was a 53-week fiscal year, there's some calendar chicanery so still last year's second best year. Over the past decade, Best Buy has averaged a return on capital of 19-and-a-half percent as per CapIQ well above their cost of capital and I will argue that the return on capital numbers for Cap IQ and Best Buy is actually too low because they put operating leases into the capital that's an argument for another time. We'll let it stand. Return on capital has also been increasing over the past decade. Also over the past decade margins are resilient and rising, gross margin has averaged 23 percent over the last decade, operating margin averaged 4.9 percent over the last decade and 5.8 percent in the last fiscal year. They have produced $17 billion in free cash flow over this decade, returning 14.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. Their dividend is up 5.5 fold over that decade, going from $0.64 a year to $3.52 a year and it's a 3.7 percent yield today.Their buybacks have reduced our shares outstanding by a third, the rest of the cash regenerated went to shore up their balance sheet, they went from a-half billion in net debt a decade ago, today have $1.75 billion in net cash today, this is a capital allocation success story and poky Best Buy that everyone knows is Amazon showroom. That's going to go away just like GameStop. How did that work out? Best Buy, 10 year annual return with dividends reinvested 18.6 percent annually a market smasher, oh and by the way if you happen to pick it up at its low in December of 2012, a time that I'm sure Brian remembers, you are sitting on a 26.8 percent annual return. That's not bad for Amazon's showroom and the final point is, no one today is surprised by, oh Amazon is going to eat their lunch. That argument has been around for over a decade, it's priced into the stock and here's this thing trading at 10 times earnings with I think blue skies and clear sailing ahead of them going forward.Ricky Mulvey: We are a minute and 26 seconds over, but a strong [laughs] bull case for Best Buy.Jim Gillies: That's pretty good for me. [laughs]Ricky Mulvey: Shocker. Jim Gillies goes a little bit over the title of it.Jim Gillies: Brian, feel free. [laughs]Ricky Mulvey: Who could've predicted it? Brian Feroldi, you've got the risks, the bear case for the company whenever you're ready.Brian Feroldi: Well, as Jim pointed out, this is a stock that I have been precisely wrong about having, giving it the red thumbs up, the thumbs down in caps, pretty much at the low which was a 10 bagger ago. Now why was I bearish on them about a decade ago? Jim hit the nail on the head and then ordered Amazon and Best Buy was becoming a showroom for Amazon's shoppers. People would go into Best Buy, look at the items, check the price online, buy it online, and Best Buy all but admitted that this was a major problem when about 10 years ago they offered a price match guarantee. If you showed them the price you could buy it online they will be forced to match it there. Now, how could Best Buy compete? Amazon doesn't have any of the overhead of the showrooms that Best Buy does. Amazon has counter positioning against Best Buy and they could offer the exact same products at a lower price. Moreover at the same time we've seen a lot of other companies, the device manufacturers themselves increased their director consumer preferences, me, the consumer can go to apple.com, samsung.com, sony.com, whatever and buy the items directly from the companies. Why go through a retailer? Now, is that still a problem today? Well, how's this stat? Last year, five suppliers, Apple, Samsung, HP, LG, and Sony, were more than 56 percent of this company's total sales and just 20 suppliers accounted for almost 80 percent of total sales. When you combine those things together I figured it was a matter of time before Best Buy joined the likes of Circuit City, Twitter, Crazy Eddie, Fredder, The Whiz, HA Creg, etc., in the retail graveyard. Now, as Jim pointed out, my thesis for this company was precisely wrong. This has been a fantastic investment over the last 10 years. But I think a lot of the things that I was worried about actually have come true. Best Buy has been modifying its store layouts. It's been forced to cut prices to match those of Internet retailers and this is a company that had almost 1,800 stores in 2013, currently they have 980 stores. The number of stores that this company has, has been falling, sinking like a stone. That's a big problem if you're going to be investing in a retailer because that's one of the major ways that a company grows, is by opening new stores that's no longer on the table. Moreover, over the last 10 years, while returns on capital have been good, this company's same-store sales, a key metric haven't exactly been barn-burning, they were negative from 2012-2014, barely positive to 2015-2017 and they've been hugely positive over the last couple of years. Why is that? In a word, COVID.People have been scrambling to build out their home offices and to make themselves electronically savvy at home. I asked this, is that something that's going to repeat? I mean once my home office was set up, why don't I have to buy any of the same items again? Make no mistake, this company even today, despite having a strong service business, 75 percent of sales come from computing, mobile phones and consumer electronics. The services business at this company that bowls are pounding the table on that was just wait for it, five percent of revenue last year, five percent of revenue. Now the company does have a couple of growth initiatives in place, they have a subscription plan growing out, they're getting into the telehealth business because when I think Best Buy what I think is healthcare, of course. I think by myself as a consumer, when I go in there and shop at Best Buy, the only thing that they want to do is talk to you about signing up for a credit card and selling me a protection plan. No thanks, I will just shop on Amazon myself. Now, if we look at the most recent quarterly results, we see a topline declining. Same-store sales are declining, gross margin down, sales and advertising expense up, and adjusted earnings-per-share down 21 percent, management all but admitted that they should expect exactly that over the next two years. Yes, this stock is cheap today but when I think of the long-term no store openings, challenging same-store sales. COVID is now a headwind supplier, concentration the retail landscape is changing, margins are going to be under pressure, and services are just five percent of sales, it's a hard pass for me.Ricky Mulvey: Gentlemen, thank you so much. That's Bull versus Bear. You can decide who made the better argument at Motley Fool Money on Twitter. Brian Feroldi, you got to book out real quick. Where can people find it?Brian Feroldi: Everywhere that books are sold, including Amazon, Best Buy's enemy.Ricky Mulvey: Why Does The Stock Market Go Up? Jim Gillies, Brian Feroldi, thank you so much.Deidre Woollard: As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. I'm Deidre Woollard, thanks for listening, we'll see you tomorrow.\n",

      "These inflation protection funds are on sale\n",
      "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/these-inflation-protection-funds-are-on-sale-11649442878\n",
      "Actual panic about inflation seems to be spiraling upward. But investments that will try to protect us from the ravages of inflation seem to be getting cheaper.Weird, right? Only on Wall Street.But this is good news for retirees, who stand more to lose from inflation than pretty much anyone else.(You may have noticed that this year’s “cost of living adjustment” to your Social Security checks, announced with so much fanfare last fall, is already a bust. Even by February official inflation was a third higher than the COLA, and the Cleveland Fed reckons inflation is now running even faster, at 8.5%. Oh, yeah, and these are only the official inflation rate.)Long-term inflation protected Treasury bonds have plunged in price since the start of the year, despite the official state of National Freak Out over rocketing prices at the supermarket and the gas pumps. And a couple of inflation-protection mutual funds favored by Bill Gates are even cheaper than that.(If you’re under 40, Bill Gates is some old guy who used to be richer than Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.)The PIMCO 15+ U.S. TIPS ETF         LTPZ,        -1.29%,       which tracks long-term inflation-protected Treasury bonds, is 15% cheaper than it was on Jan. 1, and TIPS bonds from Uncle Sam are now guaranteeing to protect your purchasing power — plus 0.2% a year — all the way through 2052. Such bonds have a positive “real” yield, meaning a yielding on top of inflation, for maturities longer than about 20 years.Three months ago, when people were much less alarmed about inflation, long-term TIPS bonds were so overpriced that they were actually guaranteeing a total 10% loss in your purchasing power over 30 years—and that was measured using the official inflation rate.Meanwhile the Western Asset Inflation-Linked Opportunities and Income Fund         WIW,        -0.56%,       a regulated U.S. mutual fund that invests in inflation-protected bonds and related assets, is also on sale and is currently selling at 90 cents on the dollar. WIW is what’s known as a “closed-end” mutual fund. That means even though it is a mutual fund, like the familiar names from companies such as Vanguard or American Funds, you invest by purchasing shares in the fund on the stock market, as you would with a stock like Apple         AAPL,        -0.78%       or Tesla         TSLA,        +1.47%.       (WIW is run by fund company Franklin Templeton.)As there are only a limited number of fund shares in circulation, the share price can move independently to the value of the fund’s investments. So right now the fund has about $13 per share in bonds and other assets, but the shares are trading around $11.60.A similar fund (also run by Franklin Templeton), Western Asset Inflation-Linked Income         WIA,        -0.36%,       is trading at 91 cents on the dollar.Bill Gates’s personal investment vehicle Cascade Investments owned more than 20% of the shares in both funds at the last count, according to public filings.I spoke to Chris Larsen, a senior product manager at Franklin Templeton and in-house expert on the two funds, to understand them a bit more. Both use leverage to increase the size of the fund, much like homeowners take out a mortgage so you can buy a bigger home. For both funds the current loan-to-value is just over 30%.This leverage, taken at short-term interest rates, has been a terrific deal while interest rates have been so low. Last year they paid about 0.2% — really—on the debt. If the money markets today are right, short-term interest rates in the next year or two will rise to about 2% or more. That could take a big chunk out of the fund’s returns.But…if the Fed hikes rates, it will presumably be because inflation isn’t under control. If that happens, we may see the value of these fund’s bonds go up sharply too because there will presumably be a lot more demand for inflation protection. Meanwhile we would probably see the fund’s share price rise even further than that, because I suspect if there is a full-scale inflation panic the market won’t still be selling off shares in inflation-protected bond funds at 90 cents on the dollar.On the other hand, if inflation fears tumble again—if today’s inflation spike turns into tomorrow’s bust—these funds could still be OK: Their short-term interest costs will stay low, and bonds—all bonds—will come back into fashion. And there’s that hefty discount. WIA currently pays out 4.1% of the share price per year in dividends, and WIW 5%.Larsen tells me that the fund managers aren’t wedded to the amount of leverage, either. If short-term interest costs rise too much, and cease to benefit the fund investors, the company will simply borrow much less. “We’ll keep that leverage on as long as we have a positive “carry,”” he tells me, meaning as long as the return from the investments is greater than the cost of the debt. “The team does adjust the leverage,” Larsen adds. “It’s not “set it (and) forget.”” Incidentally, both funds have expense rates of about 0.7% to 0.8%. Even after accounting for fees, both have outperformed plain vanilla TIPS funds over 5 and 10 years, in part because of the leverage. They also hold assets other than TIPS, such as corporate and emerging market bonds. WIW is supposedly the slightly “riskier” fund of the two, and invests a bit more in things like emerging market bonds, which tend be more volatile.You pays your money and takes your choice, as they say. Or one can buy unleveraged long-term TIPS bonds.What is the actual outlook for inflation? Well, the latest numbers show the bond market is getting less concerned than it was a few weeks ago: It now expects inflation to average 3.26% a year over the next 5 years, down from a forecast of 3.6% just a few weeks ago. We shall see.Once upon a time, over a decade ago, TIPS bonds paid guaranteed interest rates of 2% a year or more above the rate of inflation. By those standards today’s rates are dismal. But what really matters for investors is how they are going to look over the years or even decades ahead.Veteran money manager Jonathan Ruffer remembers the double-digit inflation of the 1970s, which was even worse in his native Britain than it was here. At the time he was a young money manager in London. He writes: “I remember a colleague in the fund management company Dunbar Group, where I worked at the time, losing his temper with a client who pointed out that she had suffered a real loss when compared with inflation. The client was told she was seeking after a ridiculous aspiration.” (Italics mine.)Back then investors, Ruffer says, “appeared to be defenceless from inflation.” He fears the same will happen again.The real inflation issue for retirees isn’t the forecast but the risk. And that’s where things like inflation-protected bonds come in useful.\n",

      "As stocks look to bounce back from their mid-week losses, software stocks could be worth looking at. For the most part, some would argue that the software industry remains a relevant part of the stock market today. After all, like it or not, the world today is extremely reliant on tech. In turn, where there is tech there is most likely software keeping said tech running in the background. Because of this, software services and the companies that offer them are likely sticking around in the long term.By and large, this would be the case as consumers and organizations alike remain eager to upgrade their tech. Speaking on this is Best Buy (NYSE: BBY) CEO, Corrie Barry. In a recent interview, Barry highlighted that Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE: BRK.A) investments in HP (NYSE: HPQ) prove this point. He says that it “exemplifies” the fact that “people are going to use technology more than ever, and they’re going to want to upgrade technology more than ever.” With this in mind, I could understand if investors are looking out for the top software stocks around.At the same time, there is no shortage of exciting developments in the vast software industry as well. Take Uber (NYSE: UBER) for example. As of earlier this week, the ride-hailing software goliath is planning to become a travel “superapp” in the U.K. Simply put, this would see Uber expanding its proprietary platform to include trains, buses, planes, and car rentals this year. It aims to accomplish all this via a series of software integrations with ticketing platforms. According to the company, this will serve as a pilot that could expand to include other countries moving forward. On that note, here are three more software stocks worth noting in the stock market now.To begin with, we will be taking a look at CrowdStrike. For those uninitiated, it is a leading player in the global cybersecurity market today. Through its comprehensive digital security portfolio, CrowdStrike brings cutting-edge software solutions to a wide array of companies. Overall, the company specializes in providing cloud workload & endpoint security, threat intelligence, and cyberattack response services. Thanks to its outstanding work in the field, CRWD stock is coming into focus in the stock market today.In detail, CrowdStrike received some positive news from the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) earlier today. This comes in the form of a provisional Impact Level 4 authorization. What this means is that CrowdStrike now has access to federal controlled unclassified information (CUI). Accordingly, with greater security clearance, CrowdStrike can better implement its cybersecurity solutions with DoD systems. This serves as a crucial win for the company as it can now deploy its proprietary Falcon platform across a broader range of government clients. The likes of which mainly involve the DoD and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) clients.While all this is great, CrowdStrike is not planning on losing its momentum anytime soon. According to chief security officer Shawn Henry, the company is aiming for Impact Level 5 already. As CrowdStrike continues to go from strength to strength, would you consider CRWD stock a top buy today?[Read More] Stock Market Today: Dow Jones, S&P 500 Open Mixed; WD-40 Up On Strong EarningsFollowing that, we have software giant, Microsoft, a company that produces computer software, electronics, and personal computers among others. The company is best known for its Microsoft Windows operating systems, which are used by billions all over the world. Its Microsoft Office suite is used for productivity and office work. MSFT stock is up by over 18% year-over-year. Impressively, the company is also one of the world’s largest software makers by revenue.Recently, the company announced that it had disrupted hacking attempts by Russian military spies aimed at breaking into Ukrainian, European Union, and American targets. In a blog post, Microsoft said that a group it nicknamed “Strontium” was using seven internet domains as part of an effort to spy on government bodies and think tanks in the European Union and the U.S. The company says that this disruption is part of an ongoing long-term investment, to take legal and technical action to seize infrastructure being used by Strontium.On March 31, 2022, the company also announced the acquisition of Minit, a leader in process mining technology that enables businesses to uncover opportunities for continuous process improvement and better operational efficiency. This comes as organizations across the globe are seeking to be more operationally resilient and accelerate their digital transformation plans. Minit currently enables businesses to transform the way they analyze, monitor, and optimize their processes. Its solutions have also helped businesses to gain deep insights into how processes run. All things considered, is MSFT stock worth investing in right now?[Read More] 4 Top Computer Hardware Stocks To Watch Right NowApple is another software company that investors could be keeping an eye out for. The tech company sells its line of premium tech products and also provides a slew of tech services for its billions of users. It is also one of the largest information technology companies in the world by revenue, totaling over $360 billion in 2021. AAPL stock has enjoyed gains of over 30% in the past year.Today, it will be making its streaming debut of Friday Night Baseball on Apple TV+. Friday Night Baseball will debut on Apple TV+ with a streaming doubleheader as the New York Mets meet the Washington Nationals at 7 p.m. and the Los Angeles Angels host the Houston Astros at 9:30 p.m. ET. The deal with Apple TV+, which has about 20 million paid subscribers in 2021, comes after ESPN slashed its broadcast rights to MLB games this season.Additionally, the company recently announced that a report by economists at Analysis Group found that third-party apps are among the most successful on the App Store. Apps can reach a massive global audience with high engagement across many popular app types. “The App Store has grown substantially throughout the years, sustaining an expanding community of developers and content creators and fueling a massive and growing ecosystem. This growth reflects the dynamism of the App Store, its community, and its ecosystem, which benefits developers, users, and Apple.” Said Juliette Caminade of Analysis Group. Given this piece of information, is AAPL stock a buy right now?\t\tIf you enjoyed this article and you’re interested in learning how to trade so you can have the best chance to profit consistently then you need to checkout this YouTube channel. \t\tCLICK HERE RIGHT NOW!!Midam Ventures, LLC | (305) 306-3854 | 1501 Venera Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146 | news@stockmarket.comMidam Ventures, LLC | (305) 306-3854 | 1501 Venera Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146 | news@stockmarket.com\n",

      "The Dow rose and the S&amp;P 500 ended lower in choppy trade on Friday, as beaten-down bank shares gained and investors grappled with how best to deal with an economy that could skid as the Federal Reserve moves to aggressively tackle inflation.The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note hit a three-year high of 2.73%, helping boost the S&amp;P banking index, which rose 1.18%, after slumping to 13-month lows on Thursday. The index is down 10.8% year to date.The big rate-sensitive lenders all rose, with JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co gaining 1.8%, Bank of America Corp 0.7%, Citigroup Inc 1.7% and Goldman Sachs Group Inc 2.3%.Since peaking at two-month highs in late March, the market has trended lower as the Fed signals it will aggressively hike rates, leading investors to reposition their portfolios. Economically sensitive value shares this year have outperformed tech-heavy growth stocks, which often depend on low rates.\"We're going into a very long-term and meaningful period of value outperforming growth. It's not merely a cyclical adjustment, but a secular story,\" said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer at wealth manager the Bahnsen Group in Newport Beach, California.\"The value-growth story is a big one and it is a byproduct of two things, which is what you want. Growth is overvalued and value is undervalued,\" he said.The Russell 1000 Value index rose 0.51% while the Russell 1000 Growth index fell 1.09% on the day.Investors are weighing the probability of a recession with two outcomes. On the one hand, the Fed could engineer a \"soft landing\" with slowing but positive growth, making banks \"woefully oversold,\" said UBS bank analyst Erika Najarian.Or a sharp slowdown is imminent, which would cause a knee-jerk bank share sale as \"owning banks in a recession is no fun,\" she said.Big U.S. banks, which kick off the first-quarter results season next week, are expected to report a large decline in earnings from a year earlier, when they benefited from exceptionally strong dealmaking and trading.\"There's always going to be a price at some point where people are going to step in and think things are cheap and they might buy,\" said Randy Frederick, managing director, trading and derivatives, at Schwab Center for Financial Research.\"Perhaps a 52-week low was enough to entice some people into the financial sector,\" Frederick said, noting the 10-year Treasury yield was at its highest level since March 2019.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 137.55 points, or 0.4%, to 34,721.12, the S&amp;P 500 lost 11.93 points, or 0.27%, to 4,488.28 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 186.30 points, or 1.34%, to 13,711.00.Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.37 billion shares.For the week, the S&amp;P fell 1.16%, the Dow lost 0.28% and the Nasdaq shed 3.86%, as the index was hit after Fed officials raised concerns about rapid rate hikes causing a slowdown. read moreShares of Tesla Inc, Nvidia Corp and Alphabet Inc fell between 1.9% and 4.5% as megacap stocks extended this week's decline as the surge in Treasury yields weighed.The NYSE FANG+TM index, which includes Amazon.com Inc and Apple Inc, fell 1.76% and semiconductor stocks slid 2.42%, extending the week's decline.Robinhood Markets Inc fell 6.88% after a report said Goldman Sachs downgraded the online brokerage, while Kroger Co jumped 2.99% on a ratings upgrade.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.20-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.66-to-1 ratio favored decliners.The S&amp;P 500 posted 58 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 53 new highs and 184 new lows.\n",

      "How Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple Fared in the Last Big Recession\n",
      "https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/04/09/how-alphabet-amazon-and-apple-fared-in-the-last-bi/\n",
      "Try to imagine life today without Alphabet (GOOG -3.89%) (GOOGL -3.78%), Amazon.com (AMZN -4.25%), and Apple (AAPL -0.78%). There would be no Google Search, no shopping online on Prime Day, and no iPhone. And there would be a lot less money in most investment portfolios.These three companies make up nearly 15% of the S&P 500 index. Over the past 10 years, the S&P 500 has risen roughly 140%. During that same period, Alphabet stock nearly quintupled. Amazon and Apple stocks delivered close to 9x gains. Without them, the stock market wouldn't have performed nearly as well as it did. Some economists and financial experts are now warning that a recession could be on the way. If they're right, the overall stock market will likely move in lockstep with Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple. But what should investors expect? Here's how Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple fared in the last big recession.Image source: Getty Images.The last U.S. recession was only two years ago. COVID-19 hit the economy hard and fast. All three big tech stocks plunged at least 20%. Both Alphabet and Apple fell more than 30%. However, the stocks also quickly recovered most if not all of their losses.This COVID-19 recession was the shortest recession in history, lasting only two months. As a result, it deserves an asterisk. Instead, let's look at how Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple fared in the last big recession. And it truly was a significant one, going down in the history books as the Great Recession.The Great Recession lasted from December 2007 through June 2009. It was caused by the financial crisis that rocked the stock market and the global economy. What happened with Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple? The picture was dismal.AMZN data by YCharts.As the chart above shows, all three stocks plummeted close to 60% below their previous highs. Even after the Great Recession officially ended, none of the stocks had fully recovered. Alphabet, then known as Google, was still down more than 40%.Can we assume that Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple would perform in a similar fashion in the next recession? The answer is an unequivocal \"no.\" Just as the recession of 2020 was an outlier because it was so short, the Great Recession is also an anomaly because it was so severe. A sample size of one simply isn't enough to go on to make any reasonable predictions about what might happen in the future. But even if we go back further in time, our sample size doesn't get much bigger.Google (now Alphabet) conducted its initial public offering in 2004. The company has only endured two recessions as a publicly traded entity -- the Great Recession and the short-lived COVID-19 recession. Amazon also went through the recession of 2001. But its stock had already lost close to 90% of its value even before that recession started because of the dot.com bubble bursting. Apple has only two additional recessions under its belt in addition to those that Amazon experienced, one in the early 1980s and the other in the early 1990s. We started out trying to answer the question, \"What should investors expect from Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple when the next recession comes?\" Unfortunately, we can't answer that question using history as a guide.One key lesson about recessions that we can easily observe is that each is different. As a result, stocks won't necessarily perform in the same way in different recessions.It's not just that recessions aren't the same. Companies change as well. Apple certainly isn't the same company now as it was during the recessions of 30 and 40 years ago. Amazon Web Services, Amazon's biggest growth driver now, didn't exist during the recession of 2001. Alphabet's Google Cloud was only in its infancy during the Great Recession. There are also different dynamics at work today for each of these stocks. For example, Alphabet and Amazon have 20-for-1 stock splits on the way. Even if the U.S. economy enters a recession before these stock splits happen, the two stocks could perform better than they otherwise would have if more retail investors buy at the lower share prices.Probably the most important lesson of all for investors, though, is that all of these stocks bounced back over time after each recession. Even if you bought shares of Google, Amazon, and Apple at the peak before the Great Recession hit, you would have still made a boatload of money -- if you had held onto those shares.No one knows for sure when the next recession will come. No one knows for sure how severe it might be. But we can know with a high level of certainty that people will continue using Google Search, shopping on Amazon, and upgrading to the next version of the iPhone.Alphabet's, Amazon's, and Apple's underlying businesses are built for the long term. Investors should therefore think long-term when buying these stocks. \n",

      "Want to Get Richer? 3 Top Stocks to Buy Now and Hold Forever\n",
      "https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/04/09/want-to-get-richer-top-stocks-to-buy-now-and-hold/\n",
      "Warren Buffett once said his favorite holding period for a stock was \"forever.\" However, simply buying and holding a stock forever -- or at least until you retire -- can be much more challenging than it sounds.Steep drawdowns can rattle your confidence and cause you to prematurely dump a stock when you should be buying more shares. New competitive threats and poor management decisions can also challenge your original thesis.However, there are still plenty of stocks that deserve to be bought and held forever in this challenging market. Here are three stocks from my own portfolio that I'd confidently hold forever: Apple (AAPL -0.78%), ASML Holding (ASML -0.90%), and Meta Platforms (META -2.77%).Image source: Getty Images.Apple is an evergreen investment for four simple reasons: Its customers are fiercely loyal to its brand, the expansion of its services ecosystem reinforces that loyalty, its massive cash pile ($203 billion in cash and marketable securities as of its latest quarter) gives it plenty of options for growing its business beyond the iPhone, and it consistently rewards long-term investors with stable dividends and well-timed buybacks.Over the past 10 years, Apple has reduced its number of outstanding shares by 38% as its stock price has risen by nearly 660%. After factoring in reinvested dividends, it's delivered a whopping total return of 785% during the decade -- which easily crushed the S&P 500's total return of nearly 300%.Past performance never guarantees future gains, but Apple still has plenty of irons in the fire. It can launch more paid services for its massive audience of 785 million paid subscribers, expand its hardware portfolio with new AR and VR devices, or even launch its long-rumored electric vehicle to kick off a fresh era of growth to offset its decelerating sales of iPhones.Apple's stock isn't cheap at 30 times forward earnings, but that premium reflects the market's confidence in its long-term growth potential. It might face a near-term slowdown as the global chip shortage and supply chain challenges disrupt its hardware shipments, but its future still looks bright.If you believe the world's appetite for smaller, denser, and more powerful chips will continue to rise, then you need to own some shares of the Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML.ASML is the world's largest producer of photolithography systems, which are used to etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. It's also the industry's only producer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems, which cost about $150 million apiece, require multiple planes to ship, and are absolutely required for the production of the world's smallest chips. ASML perfected its EUV technology over the past three decades, which makes it practically impossible for smaller photolithography system makers to crack the market.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Samsung, and Intel all use ASML's current-gen EUV machines, and they'll continue to use its next-gen \"high-NA\" EUV machines to manufacture even smaller chips. Those sticky relationships make ASML a linchpin of the global semiconductor market.Like Apple, ASML returns a lot of its cash to investors through buybacks and dividends. It reduced its number of outstanding shares by 28% over the past 10 years as its stock price surged more than 880%. After factoring in its dividends, it generated a market-crushing total return of over 1,000%.ASML faces some near-term supply constraints and its stock might seem a bit pricey at 36 times forward earnings. However, its monopolization of a key piece of chipmaking technology, its rock-solid growth rates, and its shareholder-friendly practices all justify that higher valuation.Meta's stock crashed in February after the social media giant predicted its revenue would only rise 3%-11% year over year in its first quarter. It blamed that slowdown on Apple's privacy update on iOS, which disrupted its targeted ads, and competition from ByteDance's TikTok. Its dedication to burning more cash with its Reality Labs metaverse business -- which posted an operating loss of $10.2 billion in 2021 -- also alarmed investors.However, Meta's sell-off also reduced its forward price-to-earnings ratio to 18, making it the cheapest FAANG stock by a mile. Even after factoring in its near-term slowdown, analysts expect Meta's revenue to rise 12% this year and grow another 17% in 2023, so it certainly isn't doomed yet.Meta still ended 2021 with a whopping 3.59 billion people -- nearly half the world's population -- using its family of apps (Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp) each month. That's up 9% from a year ago. It also holds a near-duopoly in digital ads across many markets with Alphabet's Google, so it will likely remain a default choice for most advertisers.Meta faces some near-term growing pains as it focuses more on video content, which is tougher to monetize, and the money-losing expansion of its metaverse business. But over the long term, Meta will likely find fresh ways to monetize its massive audience and generate better returns for its investors.\n",

      "Surprised young man is opening a large cardboard box with something exciting inside itThese days, everyone is on guard for a recession. And the inverted yield curve is only adding to those fears.Sure, a recession may be in the offing, but I don’t see one starting anytime soon. I don’t know about you, but I’ve never seen a recession hit when corporate profits are soaring like they are today—up 40% from pre-pandemic levels and forecast to keep rising:Corporate Profits ClimbThis “profits-up, stocks-down” dynamic (the S&P 500 is still down about 4% from the start of the year as I write this) makes now a good time to buy, particularly if you’re doing so through my favorite high-yield investments: closed-end funds (CEFs), like the one we’ll discuss below.CEF investors have two advantages over those who limit themselves to S&P 500 stocks:Of course, this is old news for CEF Insider members. Our portfolio yields 7.4% today, and our stock funds hold plenty of blue chips, including Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH).Below we’re going to delve into a stock-focused CEF that yields 10.3%, trades at a 13.3% discount to NAV and holds upstart tech companies whose sales are growing fast—so fast they’ll squeeze out any worries about rising interest rates.To see why now is a good time to make a move into stocks, especially through CEFs, take a look at the chart of forecast S&P 500 profits for the balance of the year below:Longer-Term Profits AboundObviously, energy is overshadowing everything these days, due to high oil prices, but today we’re zeroing in on that information-technology number, which looks particularly attractive with the NASDAQ off 10% this year, despite having the third-fastest forecast profit growth. This is where our “double discounted” 10.3%-yielding CEF comes in.A CEF “Discount Sale” on Fast-Growing TechsA wild card in all of this has been the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes, which have spooked many investors because they think rate hikes will raise companies’ borrowing costs—driving down their profits in the process.And while it’s true that rate hikes will make debt more costly for the most debt-laden firms, it’s also true that many companies out there have little to no debt, while others are growing so quickly that they’ll be able to shake off the effects of rising rates.Those are the companies we’re looking for. We also want to find stocks with low price-to-sales ratios to be sure we’re getting a deal on that growth (which, in itself, gives us some downside protection).One fund that holds such companies is the BlackRock Innovation and Growth Trust (BIGZ).As you can tell from the name, BIGZ is a tech-first fund focused on companies growing quickly in new markets or upending established ones. At the same time, they’re comparatively well-established. Examples of BIGZ holdings include Five9 (FIVN), Entegris (ENTG), 10x Genomics (TXG), Bio-Techne Corp (TECH) and Masimo Corp. (MASI). In this environment, they’re great options.Outlook for BIGZ top holdingsEach of these companies shares two similarities: strong revenue growth (in red above) and reasonable valuations, based on their price-to-sales ratios (in blue). What’s more they all boast in-demand products, such as medical devices (Masimo), cloud computing (Five9), computer hardware (Entegris), or biotech innovations (10X Genomics) and Bio-Techne).These fast-growing tech firms are the Teslas and Apples of tomorrow, priced low today, just as those firms were in their younger years. And thanks to BIGZ’s CEF structure, you get that whopping 10.3% dividend yield at 13.3% below the fund’s market price.That discount is hardly deserved, especially when you consider that BIGZ is backed by BlackRock, the world’s largest investment firm, with its unbeatable resources and talent base. This deal only exists because BIGZ is young, having been launched just last year, and CEF investors are a risk-averse lot, so they haven’t given it the higher valuation it deserves–yet.Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

      "These 2 Meme Stocks Have Legitimate Long-Term Upside\n",
      "https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/04/09/these-2-meme-stocks-have-legitimate-long-term-upsi/\n",
      "Most investors can identify AMC Entertainment and GameStop as being among the top meme stocks, but the further down the list you go, the murkier it gets. Many might not realize that stocks like Apple or Tesla are also meme stocks in a sense; they have at times attracted sudden, outsized attention in internet chat rooms and social media and enjoyed a surge in their stock price as small, individual investors piled into their shares. To most people, though, meme stocks are the market's underdogs, not industry titans. Their shares are heavily shorted as the so-called \"smart money\" bets their stocks will go down, and maybe even the company will go under. That's why AMC and GameStop are often the most recognizable since they are swimming against the tide, trying to turn their respective businesses around.While there could be some good arguments in their favor, I believe instead that the two meme stocks below have the best potential to be long-term winners.Image source: Getty Images.Suffering from years of neglect and resting on its laurels, Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY -4.84%) saw its share of the home goods market erode as competition from the likes of Amazon, Walmart, Target, and Wayfair ended up doing better than what the retailer used to do best.However, Bed Bath & Beyond began its turnaround much earlier than many other meme stocks that are today in hurry-up mode to survive. Its plans were just gaining traction when they got put on hold by the pandemic. However, the retailer is making smart business moves to survive and thrive in the future.The market has been impatient with Bed Bath & Beyond's pace of progress -- such as after January's third-quarter earnings report missed estimates -- but underneath the hood the retailer saw record customer acquisition gains, adding almost half a million new members. The company will report fourth-quarter results soon, and cash profits may be temporarily negative because of seasonal stocking up on inventory for the holidays. However, investors may want to use any weakness in its stock to jump in. GameStop's Ryan Cohen has taken an activist investor stake in the business and is calling for Bed Bath & Beyond to shed more businesses or even put itself up for sale. There are a lot of moving parts with the retailer, but Wall Street expects profits to grow rapidly over the next five years as its turnaround plan gains traction once more. That could see its shares rise in tandem with them.Image source: Ford.Ford's (F 5.10%) inclusion on the list of meme stocks might surprise some, but it caught the attention of the Reddit crowd last year and its stock soared 136%. However, 2022 hasn't been as kind with the automaker's shares falling 28% so far this year.That's due to the realities of the global supply-chain crunch causing a massive industry shortage of computer chips and other parts, rampant inflation, and rising interest rates. No doubt, the persistent problems are weighing on Ford, but it's also clear they're affecting everyone, not just the automaker. Ford's trying to make the best of a bad situation. To generate sales, it's beginning to ship vehicles without non-safety-related chips installed, but promising to put them in within a year. Deliveries may still fall, regardless, as new-car prices soar, but investors can still buy into an otherwise solid stock at deeply discounted prices.Shares of Ford trade at just three times trailing earnings and six times next year's estimate. It also goes for a bargain-basement six times the free cash flow it produces even as the company begins to flex its electric car muscles.The automaker says it wants to be producing 2 million EVs by 2026, which could be achievable as its EV sales are already racing ahead of the industry. Its Mustang Mach-E continues to gain traction over last year, its Transit Pro commercial van just hit the market, and its F-150 Lightning pickup is due out soon.Ford has the potential to light up sales in the years to come in both internal combustion engine vehicles and in its growing electric fleet.\n",

      "Despite a three-month lockout that was the first for Major League Baseball in 25 years, teams are now worth more than they were the previous year. Here’s a look at the ten most valuable MLB teams and two stocks investors should keep on watch.What Happened: Major League Baseball teams are worth $2.07 billion on average, a gain of 9% year-over-year.Among the new catalysts for baseball teams are jersey patch deals, which will allow teams to dictate their own team sponsors and gain additional revenue. Forbes estimates the sponsorships could generate over $400 million for all 30 teams annually when combined.Another catalyst is the expansion of the MLB Playoffs, adding an additional two teams to the postseason. The added playoff games will bring an additional $2 million annually to teams thanks to television rights from ESPN, a unit of The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS).Additionally, new streaming deals with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) add $115 million annually for teams to split. Major League Baseball will now see annual television and streaming rights pass the $2 billion mark on an annual basis.\t\tLocal television rights deals help teams on an individual basis, with Sinclair Broadcast Group (NASDAQ:SBGI) among the leaders in carrying MLB teams on a local level.The Los Angeles Dodgers led the league last season with $189 million in cable television fees. The New York Yankees, Philadelphia Phillies, Los Angeles Angels and Texas Rangers round out the top five for the top local cable revenue teams.Most Valuable MLB Teams: In March, Forbes put out its annual MLB team rankings, showing the value of each team and how much the team generated in operating income, or in some cases lost on the full year. Here are the ten most valuable MLB teams.New York YankeesWorth: $6 billion, +14%\t\tOperating Income: -$40 millionThe Yankees are the first MLB team to pass the $6 billion value mark, and rank second only to the NFL’s Dallas Cowboys for the title of most valuable North American sports team.Los Angeles DodgersWorth: $4.08 billion, +14%Operating Income: -$8 million\t\tThe Dodgers ranked first in cable television revenue and have performed well in the postseason the last few years. For the 2022 season, manager Dave Roberts recently guaranteed a World Series win, something that could boost the team’s value even more.Boston Red SoxWorth: $3.9 billion, +13%Operating Income: $69 millionThe Red Sox had one of the best operating income figures of the top ten most valuable teams in the last season.\t\tChicago CubsWorth: $3.8 billion, +13%Operating Income: $68 millionThe Chicago Cubs saw a nice gain of 13% and also had positive operating income in the last year.San Francisco GiantsWorth: $3.5 billion, +10%Operating Income: $32 millionThe Giants had one of the best records in baseball last season and continue to rank near the top ten for attendance and price charged per ticket.New York MetsWorth: $2.65 billion, +8%\t\tOperating Income: $96 millionThe Mets were the top producing team of the top ten in operating income for the last season.

The Angels are a big contender for sportsbooks to have a rebound year in 2022 and contend for the World Series with Mike Trout healthy.Atlanta BravesWorth: $2.1 billion, +12%Operating Income: $83 millionThe Braves won their first World Series since 1995 in the last MLB season.Related Link: Atlanta Braves Launching MLB Stadium In The Metaverse: Here's The Details And Why This Is ExcitingTwo Stocks To Watch: The Braves, who gained 12% in their value in 2022 were the World Series winners.

The stock experienced a short boost in valuation with the success of the Braves in the 2021 postseason, and a strong 2022 season could propel shares back to new highs once again.Another team that is part of a publicly traded company is the Toronto Blue Jays. The Blue Jays are owned by Rogers Communications (NYSE:RCI), a Canadian telecommunications and media company.Rogers is exploring selling a stake in the Blue Jays and the team’s stadium. The sale of a stake or the entire team is being done to help the company pay down debt ahead of its pending acquisition of Shaw Communications (NYSE:SJR).The Blue Jays placed 14th on the Forbes MLB team rankings, valued at $1.78 billion, up 6% from the previous year. The team had an operating loss of $52 million in the last season.A sale price of the Blue Jays is rumored in the $2 billion range, ahead of the Forbes rankings, which could provide a boost to the valuation of Rogers Communications.\n",
